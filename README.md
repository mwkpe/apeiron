# apeiron

A small framework for basic scene and data visualization using OpenGL

Apeiron is using [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader), [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) and [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), and additionally requires [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew), [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) which are not part of this repository and must be added into the external directory. The example project also requires [JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

See usage examples [here](https://github.com/mwkpe/apeiron-examples).
